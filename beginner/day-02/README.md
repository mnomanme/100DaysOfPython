**Beginner**

## Day 02 Exercise 01
## Data Types

# Instructions

Write a program that adds the digits in a 2-digit number. e.g., if the input was 35, then the output should be 3 + 5 = 8

**Warning.** Do not change the code on lines 1-3. Your program should work for different inputs. e.g. any two-digit number.

# Example Input

```
39
```

# Example Output

3 + 9 = 12

```
12
```

e.g. When you hit **run**, this is what should happen:

# Hint

1. Try to find out the data type of two_digit_number.
2. Think about what you learnt about subscripting.
3. Think about type conversion.

# Instructions

Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.

The BMI is a measure of some's weight taking into account their height. e.g. If a tall person and a short person both weigh the same amount, the short person is usually more overweight.

The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):

**Warning** you should convert the result to a whole number. 

# Example Input

```
weight = 80
```

```
height = 1.75
```

# Example Output

80 Ã· (1.75 x 1.75) =  26.122448979591837

```
26
```

e.g. When you hit **run**, this is what should happen:

# Hint

1. Check the data type of the inputs.
2. Try to use the exponent operator in your code.
3. Remember PEMDAS.
4. Remember to convert your result to a whole number (int).

# Instructions

I was reading this article by Tim Urban - Your Life in Weeks and realised just how little time we actually have.

[https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html)

Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many days, weeks, months we have left if we live until 90 years old. 

It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:

> You have x days, y weeks, and z months left. 

Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers. 

 

**Warning** your output should match the Example Output format exactly, even the positions of the commas and full stops. 

# Example Input

```
56
```

# Example Output

```
You have 12410 days, 1768 weeks, and 408 months left.
```

e.g. When you hit **run**, this is what should happen:

# Hint

1. There are 365 days in a year, 52 weeks in a year and 12 months in a year.
2. Try copying the example output into your code and replace the relevant parts so that the sentence is formated the same way.

## Day 02 Project
## Tip Calculator

# Instructions

If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip. 

Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6

Format the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60

Thus everyone's share of the total bill is $30.00 plus a $3.60 tip.

Tip: There are 2 ways to round a number. You might have to do some Googling to solve this.ðŸ’ª


# Example Input

```
Welcome to the tip calculator!
What was the total bill? $124.56
How much tip would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15? 12
How many people to split the bill? 7
```

# Example Output

```
Each person should pay: $19.93
```
