## Day 02 Exercise 01
## Data Types

# Instructions

Write a program that adds the digits in a 2-digit number. e.g., if the input was 35, then the output should be 3 + 5 = 8

**Warning.** Do not change the code on lines 1-3. Your program should work for different inputs. e.g. any two-digit number.

# Example Input

```
39
```

# Example Output

3 + 9 = 12

```
12
```

e.g. When you hit **run**, this is what should happen:

# Hint

1. Try to find out the data type of two_digit_number.
2. Think about what you learnt about subscripting.
3. Think about type conversion.

# Instructions

Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.

The BMI is a measure of some's weight taking into account their height. e.g. If a tall person and a short person both weigh the same amount, the short person is usually more overweight.

The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):

**Warning** you should convert the result to a whole number. 

# Example Input

```
weight = 80
```

```
height = 1.75
```

# Example Output

80 รท (1.75 x 1.75) =  26.122448979591837

```
26
```

e.g. When you hit **run**, this is what should happen:

# Hint

1. Check the data type of the inputs.
2. Try to use the exponent operator in your code.
3. Remember PEMDAS.
4. Remember to convert your result to a whole number (int).
